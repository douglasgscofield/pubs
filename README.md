----------------------------------------

[R] scripts for performing diversity analyses described in Scofield DG, Smouse PE, Karubian J

Brannstrom-et-al-1
---------------

OTU clustering of IonTorrent IonXpress amplicon sequences via [USEARCH], and additional [R] scripts for analysis.  Includes alignments and phylogenies underlying figures.

[USEARCH]:    http://drive5.com/usearch


Dahlo-et-al-1
-------------

[R] code and data for generating figures from Dahl√∂ et al., "Tracking the NGS
revolution: managing life science research on shared high-performance computing
clusters".  Most of these were written to work with the original non-anonymised
datasets (those generating figures 1, 4, S1), so may have some trouble working
with the anonymised datasets.  Datasets for Figures 2, 3 and 5 are included
here.
