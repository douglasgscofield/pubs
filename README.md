Publication materials
=====================

Repository for scripts, etc. associated with publications.


Brannstrom-et-al-1
---------------

Onuț-Brännström I, Benjamin M, Scofield DG, Heiðmarsson S, Andersson MGI, Lindström ES, Johannesson H. 2018.  Sharing of photobionts in sympatric populations of Thamnolia and Cetraria lichens: evidence from high-throughput sequencing. _Scientific Reports_ **8**: 4406.

OTU clustering of IonTorrent IonXpress amplicon sequences via [USEARCH], and additional [R] scripts for analysis.  Includes alignments and phylogenies underlying figures.

Dahlo-et-al-1
-------------

[R] code and data for generating figures from Dahlö et al., "Tracking the NGS
revolution: managing life science research on shared high-performance computing
clusters".  Most of these were written to work with the original non-anonymised
datasets (those generating figures 1, 4, S1), so may have some trouble working
with the anonymised datasets.  Datasets for Figures 2, 3 and 5 are included
here.

Richert-et-al-1
---------------

[R] scripts for performing various analyses described in Richert *et al.* Spring comes to the Antarctic Ocean: Surface phytoplankton biomass shapes bacterioplankton community diversity far into the dark ocean.



Scofield et al. American Naturalist 2012
----------------------------------------

[R] scripts for performing diversity analyses described in Scofield DG, Smouse PE, Karubian J
and Sork VL, Using alpha, beta and gamma diversity measures to characterize seed dispersal
by animals, _American Naturalist_ **180**:719-732, are available under the `dispersalDiversity` repository:

Vidalis et al. bioRxiv
----------------------

BED files delineating sequence capture probe sites anchored to the _Picea abies_ 1.0 genome
assembly and annotation.
