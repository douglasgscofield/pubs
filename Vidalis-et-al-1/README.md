2018.  Design and evaluation of a large sequence-capture probe set and
associated SNPs for diploid and haploid samples of Norway spruce (_Picea
abies_).  bioRxiv <https://doi.org/10.1101/291716>

All files are anchored to the _Picea abies_ 1.0 genome assembly and annotation.
Where a probe falls within a gene model, the model is listed (e.g,
`MA_20601g0010:MC`).

### Pabies1.0_probe_sites_pilot.bed

BED file delineating 80,000 pilot probe sites.

### Pabies1.0_probe_sites_diploid.bed

BED file delineating 40,018 probe sites selected for use with diploid samples
from throughout the range of _P. abies_.

### Pabies1.0_probe_sites_megagam.bed

BED file delineating 31,277 probe sites selected for use with haploid
megagametophyte samples related to the Z4006 sequenced tree, for assembly
improvement and evaluation.
